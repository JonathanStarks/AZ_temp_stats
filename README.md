# Phoenix AZ Temperature Statistics
This will show the change in temperature in the City of Phoenix over 40 years.

I made this program for a couple of reasons, the first and main reason was because I wanted to see how clean of a graph I could make in python, I've used Tableau in the past and I wanted to compare the two. The second reason was I wanted to answer a couple of questions (see the section below) in a way that was way more complicated than I needed to make it. Googleing it would have been faster, but it wouldn't have been nearly as fun.
